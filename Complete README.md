# Housing Market Trends Analysis

This project performs an exploratory analysis of a housing dataset to identify trends and generate insights about the housing market. The analysis includes loading the data, displaying key statistics, and summarizing important features of the dataset using Python and Pandas.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. For deployment instructions, refer to the Deployment section.

### Project Description

The Python script in this repository performs the following tasks:

- Loads housing market data from a CSV file
- Calculates key statistics and trends in the housing market
- Visualizes the data using various plots

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running:

1. **Download the Project Files:** Download the project files directly from the repository.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
3. **Install Required Python Packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```
4. **Run the Analysis Script:**
    ```sh
    python housing_analysis.py
    ```

### Running the Tests

To verify the functionality of the Housing Market Trends Analysis script, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:** Ensure you have Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib installed.
2. **Prepare Your Data:**
    - Place the `housing[1].csv` file in the specified location and update the file_path variable in the script:
    ```python
    file_path = 'path/to/your/housing[1].csv'  # Change this to your actual file path
    ```
3. **Run the Script:**
    ```sh
    python housing_analysis.py
    ```

### Breakdown of Tests

- The script loads housing market data from a CSV file.
- It calculates key statistics and trends in the housing market.
- It visualizes the data using various plots.

### Deployment

For deploying this project on a live system, ensure that:

- Python and required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) are installed on the system.
- The `housing[1].csv` file is correctly placed and the file path in the script is updated accordingly.
